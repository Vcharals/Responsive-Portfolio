      <p>I am a Qualtiy Assurance Tester turned Full Stack Developer. With the passion to continuously learn I have gradually turned my focus from solely testing front and back end services to create webpages and web applications. I have always had the passion to learn in the tech world but it wasn't until 2014 that I decided to professionally seek knowledge in the IT world.</p>

      <p>I initially started out as a QA intern at ID Software, where I tested the game DOOM for defects before releasing it to the public. At ID Software, I learned how to effective log defects via Hansoft. This internship helped me really focus on pure defect tracking and logging while learning about about the SDLC. From there I moved to a small start up company called Vinli where I focused on testing over a 150 services including 5 webpages. Here I learned the true inner workings of the front end and backend development cycle. I also learned how to search for solutions via previous and newly acquired knowledge.</p>

      <p>Finally, I chose to join SMU's Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp to further my skillset and to be more well rounded in the IT world. Here we covered many different programming languages such as, HTML, JavaScript, PHP, and SQL. It was very daunting to switch over from testing to coding but well worth it. With the proper education, practice outside of the classroom setting, and work on homework/projects, I was able to understand and master many of these languages in ways I never thought I could. If you would like to know more about me or my career experience, please feel free to contact me via the contact page at any time! </p>
